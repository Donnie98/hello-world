# hello-world

with your feet in the air and your head on the ground
try this trick and spin it, yeah
your head will collapse
but there's nothing in it
and you'll ask yourself
where is my mind?
where is my mind?
where is my mind?
way out in the water
see it swimming
i was swimming in the carribean
animals were hiding behind the rocks
except the little fish
but they told me, he swears
trying to talk to me to me to me
where is my mind?
where is my mind?
where is my mind?
